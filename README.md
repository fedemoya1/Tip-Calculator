# This is my fourth challenge from FrontendMentor.io

- In this project  I used only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
- I took this challenge just to show my skills. It might has some errors but Im still learning and I will improve.
- This is a tip calculator, you can enter any (number)value in the bill input, select the percentage of the tip and the number of people that are going to pay. 
- It shows how much each person is going to pay in total and how much is the tip per person. 
- It is responsive made mobile first.
